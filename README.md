# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

For my initial project, I wanted to find a dataset that would provide me the opportunity to create domain and business-based questions, then answer them through exploratory data      analysis (EDA) and visualisations. I selected a  Netflix dataset from Kaggle for this purpose. 
This project was centred on performing EDA and bringing together my learning across different university units and the Codecademy data analytics course. A key limitation of this dataset was the smaller sample size in earlier years, reflecting Netflix’s expansion over time as well as the global expansion of the entertainment industry. This made the analysis of early years less reliable and required extra caution, but importantly, provided a good challenge and learning experience.

Business & Domain Questions

1. How has the number of movies released on Netflix changed over time?
2. How has the typical movie duration changed over time?
3. Are there specific time periods where movie durations significantly increased or decreased?
4. Which countries produce the highest number of Netflix movies?
5. How does movie duration vary by country?
6. Is there a relationship between release year and movie availability growth?
7. How has the number of TV shows added to Netflix changed over time?
8. How has the number of seasons per TV show evolved?
9. Which countries produce the most TV shows on Netflix?
10. Do TV show season counts vary significantly by country?
